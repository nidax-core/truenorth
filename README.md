# TrueNorth
True North is an initiative by Nidax.

The name "True North" is used as a project name and concept. 
Use of the name does not imply permission for branding or commercial use.
It is an open human-scale framework for secure digital collaboration.
It focuses on strong identity, clear boundaries and vendor-neutral architecture.
So organizations can run their core digital services with confidence and autonomy.

This repository is the home of the **True North vision, principles, and proofs of concept**.
It is intentionally lightweight and iterative.

## Why True North

Modern organizations depend on critical digital infrastructure, yet often lose:
- control over identity and access;
- insight into how systems are connected;
- and freedom to evolve without vendor lock-in.

True North explores a different approach:
- strong identity as the foundation;
- security embedded by design;
- collaboration without opacity;
- and technology that remains understandable and auditable.

## Proofs of Concept

The `/poc` directory contains focused Proofs of Concept.
Each PoC is intentionally scoped to validate a single architectural idea not to build a full product.

The first PoC focuses on **central identity and access**:
- one identity;
- strong authentication at the boundary;
- smooth, policy-driven access to multiple services.

## License and intent

True North is licensed under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3 (AGPL-3.0)**.

This license is a conscious choice.
It ensures that improvements remain shared including when the software is
used to provide services over a network. Commercial use is allowed but
closed and/or extractive use is not the goal of this project.

True North exists to create shared value.
Any commercial activity should respect that spirit.

## Status

This project is under active exploration.
Expect clarity before speed and structure before scale.
