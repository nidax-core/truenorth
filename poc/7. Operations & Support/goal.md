# Goal — Operations & Support

## Purpose

Make the system operable by real people.

This domain ensures the environment can be run, supported and recovered with predictable procedures.
It treats operational clarity as part of the architecture.

## What success looks like (verifiable)

- Onboarding and migration procedures exist and can be executed without hidden steps.
- The most common operational tasks have runbooks with clear preconditions and expected outcomes.
- Incidents follow a consistent lifecycle with ownership, evidence, and post-incident learning.
- Support requests are routed to the correct owners with predictable response paths.
- Operators can answer basic questions quickly: what is running, who owns it, and how to fix common failures.

---

## Non-goals (for this PoC)

- A full ITSM suite and enterprise process model.
- 24/7 on-call coverage with strict SLAs.
- A complete training program.
- Automating every possible operation (Domain 5 covers automation primitives).

## Why this matters to True North

Systems that cannot be explained cannot be trusted.
If operation requires heroics or tribal knowledge, the architecture is not complete.
