# Goal — Security, Observability & Compliance

## Purpose

Make security visible, measurable and explainable.

This domain provides the telemetry and auditability needed to operate True North systems with confidence.
It supports incident response, operational debugging and compliance reporting without turning the stack into a black box.

## What success looks like (verifiable)

- Core hosts and services emit logs with reliable timestamps and stable identifiers.
- A central system can answer: what happened, where, when and by whom.
- Alerts are actionable: each alert includes evidence links (raw events) and context (asset/service/user).
- File integrity monitoring (FIM) and intrusion-relevant detections exist for critical assets.
- Administrative actions and critical changes are auditable (who did what, when).

---

## Non-goals (for this PoC)

- A full enterprise SOC operation.
- Coverage for every possible attack technique.
- Implementing a complete compliance framework (ISO/NIST) end-to-end.
- High-volume “everything is an alert” monitoring.

## Why this matters to True North

True North values systems that are understandable and auditable.
Without observability, security becomes opinion; without audit trails, compliance becomes paperwork.
