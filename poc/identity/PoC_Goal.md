# Proof of Concept Goal

This Proof of Concept demonstrates that True North can provide users with
secure access to multiple core services through a single, central, MFA-protected and auditable identity.

It applies strict verification at the point of access, followed by smooth, 
policy-driven reauthentication during use without local accounts or vendor lock-in.
