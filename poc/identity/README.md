# Identity Proof of Concept

This Proof of Concept explores identity as the foundational layer of True North.

It demonstrates how a single central identity can securely and transparently
provide access to multiple services while remaining understandable, auditable and vendor-neutral.

This PoC is intentionally minimal and scoped.
It is not a production setup.
