# Goal — Collaboration & Productivity

The goal of the Collaboration & Productivity domain is to provide a **coherent, human-scale digital workspace** without creating dependency on a single platform or vendor.

This domain exists to support daily work, not to centralize control.

---

## Primary goal

Enable people to:
- communicate
- collaborate
- schedule
- co-create documents

…without coupling these activities to identity, analytics or proprietary ecosystems.

---

## What success looks like

This domain is successful when:

- Users experience a single, understandable workspace
- Email, chat, meetings and documents coexist without replacing each other
- Collaboration tools can be replaced without breaking identity or data ownership
- No single component becomes a system of record for users or data
- Operators can explain the setup without vendor-specific knowledge

---

## What this domain explicitly does not try to solve

- Identity lifecycle management
- Data analytics or reporting
- Endpoint security or DLP enforcement
- Organizational policy beyond workspace-level sharing

Attempting to solve these within the workspace is considered failure, not ambition.

---

## Guiding principle

> Productivity should reduce cognitive load not increase dependency.

The Collaboration & Productivity domain exists to support work not to define how organizations must work.
