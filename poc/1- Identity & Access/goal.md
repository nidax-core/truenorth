# Proof of Concept Goal

This Proof of Concept demonstrates that True North can provide users with
secure access to multiple core services through a single central and auditable identity domain.

Authentication and access enforcement are applied consistently across services,
using protocol-appropriate mechanisms while maintaining a unified identity lifecycle.

Where supported, access is protected by multi-factor authentication and centralized policy enforcement.
No service manages local user accounts or credentials and no vendor-specific identity lock-in is introduced.
