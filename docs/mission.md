# True North — Mission

**True North** is an open, human-scale digital workspace framework that helps organizations run their core collaboration, identity, and security infrastructure without vendor lock-in.

It brings together proven open-source technologies into a coherent, secure, and understandable platform, with clear defaults, guided rollouts, and long-term operational support.

True North is designed for organizations that value:
- Predictability over rapid churn
- Auditability over opacity
- Autonomy over dependency
- European values of privacy, openness and accountability

---

## What True North is

- An integration-first framework, not a monolithic product
- A coherent workspace built from well-established open-source components
- A practical alternative to proprietary digital workspaces
- A guide for architecture, rollout and day-to-day operations
- A long-term partner focused on clarity, security and control

## What True North is not

- A hyperscaler or cloud monopoly
- A feature-for-feature replacement for Microsoft or Google
- A collection of loosely bundled open-source tools
- A “DIY and good luck” platform without support
- An open-core product with hidden lock-in

## Design principles

### Integration over invention
We prioritize integrating proven open-source technologies over building new ones.
Value comes from cohesion, sane defaults and interoperability — not from reinventing tools that already work.

### Transparency over abstraction
Systems must be understandable and inspectable.
Configuration, identity flows, security controls, and logs are visible, explainable and auditable — never hidden behind black boxes.

### Control over convenience
Ease of use must not come at the cost of autonomy.
Organizations retain ownership of their data, identity and exit paths, even if that means fewer “one-click” shortcuts.

## How True North creates value

True North acts as:
- The architect: designing sane and interoperable systems
- The integrator: making components work together cleanly
- The guide: providing rollout, migration and operational clarity
- The safety net: offering support, security baselines and accountability

## Open source integrity & exit strategy

True North is built on open standards first and open-source components second.

We deliberately distinguish between *open source* and *open core*.
Components that place essential functionality such as identity, federation or access control behind commercial paywalls are excluded from the reference architecture.

True North does not depend on the permanence or goodwill of any single vendor.
Instead, it is designed around:
- Open, well-defined protocols (e.g. OIDC, SAML, LDAP)
- Clear interface boundaries
- Explicit documentation of architectural decisions

Forkability is not a goal, but an essential safety valve.
Every core component must be legally and technically replaceable without breaking the system’s fundamental guarantees.

Commercial support, hosting and enterprise services are compatible with True North.
Technical lock-in at the identity or control plane is not.
