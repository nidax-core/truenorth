# True North — Vision

True North is an open human-scale framework for secure digital collaboration.

It aims to give organizations clear ownership over identity, access and their data without vendor lock-in or opaque dependencies.

Security is treated as a shared foundation not a specialist add-on.
Technology should remain understandable, auditable and evolvable over time.

True North values openness, autonomy and long-term responsibility over speed or hype.
